1.What is Gradle?

It's a build tool, which help us to create java project, manage dependencies, versions, test and of course build the project.

We have an empty project, so how to start?
Easy - just `gradle init`
Explain about the generated script build.gradle, setting.gradle and main concept of gradle - tasks (show them using ./gradlew tasks --all)

2. Create task by your own to show how it's easy (task it's like a function) 

task myFirstTask() {
    println 'Rakuten beauty is the best team!'
}

3. Show the gradle lifecycle 

Initialization, configuration, execution.
When each phaze is triggered.
Should take care during creation of your tasks, because configuration phaze is always executing, and could consume a lot of time.

4. Task output - the way how gradle reduces time of execution the tasks.
How to enable output for your custom task.

outputs.files "$rootDir/test.txt"

That's why using clean - is antipattern in gradle, because it removes output of the task.

5. Task input - in case if our output depends on something, we can use task input.
Show that it really works by changing LocalDate to LocalDateTime

6. Task caching - even more cool thing. In case if you delete your output - it puts it to the special cache.
To enable caching for the task pls do next:
outputs.cacheIf { true }

7. Multi module project
Show how 1 project using other as an implementation dependency.
If have time - say about configurations.
